<h3>EmptyPedal</h3>
I decided to "Standardize" my pedals. I just created a empty pedal with the barrel jack, input and output ports, and a optional footswitch thing. 
They are all wrapped in a single footprint so that I don't have to painstakingly draw and measure every part to be the same size in the same place every time.</br>
I also have a variant without the footswitch, in case I need a pedal with a different pedal position.</br>
The pedal has a width of 68.58mm(2.7in) and a height of 97.79mm(3.85in)
